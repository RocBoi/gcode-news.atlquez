      <p><strong>Clayton County, GA</strong> — Atlanta’s own underground hip-hop legend, Marquez "RocBoi Quez" Ross, was recently apprehended and detained due to two separate warrants issued in Georgia counties. The artist, known for his gritty lyricism and revolutionary street legacy, found himself at the center of legal controversy that fans and supporters are now calling a systemic injustice.</p>

      <p>One warrant was issued in <strong>Fulton County</strong>, alleging charges of child cruelty and simple battery involving a past relationship. The other came from <strong>Gwinnett County</strong>, accusing the artist of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon — another allegation rooted in old circumstances. However, investigations revealed that the Fulton County charges were ultimately <strong>dropped and dismissed</strong> due to lack of evidence and clear indications of false pretenses.</p>

      <p>The situation in Gwinnett County further exposed flaws in the system. Despite there being <strong>no witnesses</strong>, <strong>no evidence</strong>, and an <strong>affidavit signed by the alleged victim</strong> confirming all claims were fabricated by third parties, RocBoi Quez was held for over three weeks. During the preliminary hearing, the affidavit was submitted to the court and the victim was excluded from proceedings — a move that continues to raise eyebrows among fans and legal observers.</p>

      <p>After spending <strong>three and a half weeks</strong> behind bars, RocBoi Quez has now been released. Sources close to the artist say he intends to speak out in his next album, which remains untitled, to address not only his personal suffering but also to shine light on the wider systemic failures affecting Black men and creatives in Georgia’s correctional facilities.</p>

      <p>This chapter adds to the legend of RocBoi Quez — not only as a formidable hip-hop force but as a survivor, and soon, a voice of justice in a crooked game. Stay tuned to <strong>GCode-News.atlquez.com</strong> for exclusive updates, album drops, and deeper truths only RocBoi Quez can deliver.</p>
